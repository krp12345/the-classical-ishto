The JavaFX based board game known as Ishto.<br>

<ul> 
&bull; The game includes one 5x5 board with 4 different houses on different sides, each containing 4 pawns. The houses are basically the 4 different cells of the board.<br> 
&bull; A player can generate a random number between 1 to 8 when the turn comes and moves the pawns accordingly. <br>
&bull; A player has two options when turn comes, either he/she can move the new pawn from the house or move any of the pawns traveling on the board.<br> 
&bull; At first, all the players have to move on the outer loop of the board.<br> 
&bull; If two different players' pawns met on a cell, the later one kicks the former one out of that cell and it has to rest again in its respective house.<br>
&bull; When any player kicks at least one pawn, he/she has said to opened the gateway to the inner loop. The gateway is set just beside the player's respective house. (left side) <br>
&bull; Similar procedure is applied in the inner loop. <br>
&bull; The final goal to make all the pawns reach to the inner most cell of the board.<br>
&bull; The player who has achieved the goal, becomes the winner.
