       <li>A player can generate a random number between 1 to 8 when the turn comes and moves the pawns accordingly.</li></h2>
       <h2><li> A player has two options when turn comes, either he/she can move the new pawn from the house or move any of the pawns traveling on the board.</li></h2>
       <h2><li> At first, all the players have to move on the outer loop of the board.</li></h2>
       <h2><li> If two different players' pawns met on a cell, the later one kicks the former one out of that cell and it has to rest again in its respective house.</li></h2>
       <h2><li> When any player kicks at least one pawn, he/she has said to opened the gateway to the inner loop. The gateway is set just beside the player's respective house. (left side) </li></h2>
       <h2><li> Similar procedure is applied in the inner loop. </li></h2>
       <h2><li> The final goal to make all the pawns reach to the inner most cell of the board.</li></h2>
